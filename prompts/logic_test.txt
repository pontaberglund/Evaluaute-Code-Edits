There is something wrong with this function. It should return the median of a list. However, for the list [10, 2, 5], it returns 2 when it should return 5. Edit the following code so that it correctly calculated the median.

def calculate_median(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the median of a list of numbers.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return None

    n = len(numbers)
    mid_index = n // 2

    if n % 2 == 1:
        return numbers[mid_index]
    else:
        return (numbers[mid_index - 1] + numbers[mid_index]) / 2
