# Evaluaute-Code-Edits

## The task
Your task is to generate code edits in three different ways using ten different models living behind the same API.
You can freely define or reuse the edition tasks from existing benchmarks, and the API to be used. But it has to be code edition (and not code generation).
Then, I ask you to write a short document comparing both the edit formats and the model performance, and giving your reflection on the task. If you're not successful, you can reflect about the main difficulties you faced.
